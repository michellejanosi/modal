/** we need to style our open and close buttons, re-use the comma , to target both buttons **/

/** modal -> remember we used an ID for this div? we can target it by doing #modal **/

/** overlay -> we also used an ID for this, so do the same as above **/
/** the overlay must overtake the screen, so how would you make the overlay 100% height and 100% width so it fills the entire screen? it also must position itself above everything else!

/* 
========= Things to note ========= 
  1) remember on the presentation we want to briefly hide the background of the modal overlay? hint: look at the notes below! rgba...
  2)
*/

/*
======== Helpers
  - rgba = red, green blue, alpha (alpha being the opacity on a scale of 0 to 1 - 0.5 sounds good?)
  - rgba is complex and it's a bit of a time sink to remember all the values, look at rgba colour values online, or rgba colour convetors, or even colour palettes!
  - if you come from a design background, you'll know you can convert HEX values (e.g. #ffffff to rgba using a convertor)
